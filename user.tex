\section{User-facing Services}

\subsection{Web Portal\label{sec:portal}}

\end{figure}

The \textbf{Portal} aspect is a web portal designed to provide the essential data
access and visualization services through a simple-to-use website.  It is to
enable browsing and visualization of the available datasets in ways the
users are accustomed to at archives such as IRSA, MAST, or the SDSS archive.
To those we will add an enhanced level of interactivity in line with expectations for
then-contemporary archive portals (similar to that found today in ESASky and
the DECaLS Viewer). Examples of the types of user experiences to be offered
through the LSST portal are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:portalESA}~and~\ref{fig:portalIRSA}.

Through the Portal, the users will be
able to view the LSST images, request subsets of data (via simple forms or
SQL queries), store the results of such queries to their personal
workspaces, as well as download them. The Portal will also make it possible to
construct commonly requested plots, and generally explore the
LSST dataset in a way that allows the users to identify and access (subsets of)
data required by their science case.

Virtually all LSST users will use the Portal as their first point of entry to
access and explore the LSST data set. When developing the Portal,
we will therefore \textbf{emphasize the user experience and exploratory
capabilities}, over analysis features. The latter are expected to be more
directly satisfied by the JupyterLab aspect.

\subsection{JupyterLab\label{sec:jupyter}}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.4}{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/fig-jupyterlabdemo}}
	\caption{A screen capture of the JupyterLab interface running LSST image processing code within a notebook. \label{fig:JupyterLab}}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{JupyterLab} aspect, based on the Jupyter family of technologies (such as
JupyterHub and JupyterLab), will be provided to allow for more sophisticated
data selection, analysis, and creation of added value (Level 3) data
products. A screen capture of a mature prototype of JupterLab is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:JupyterLab}.

The JupyterLab user experience will be nearly identical to working with
Jupyter notebooks locally, except that computation and analysis will occur
at resources provided at the LSST Data Access Center.  This is an
implementation of the “bringing analysis to the data” paradigm: rather
than imposing the burden of downloading, storing, and processing (large)
subsets of LSST data at their home institutions, we will enable our users to
bring their codes and perform their analysis at the LSST DAC.  We expect
this will reduce the barrier to entry and shorten the path to science for
the LSST science community.

We will provide JupyterLab instances to LSST users in an environment carrying a
library of preinstalled commonly used and useful software tools:
Astropy, the LSST science pipelines, Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution,
and others. The users will be able to upload and install their own tools as well.
Non-trivial shared computing cluster resources will be accessible through this
environment as well, enabling Level 3 data products generation.

% Add something about writing glue code to make it easy to submit jobs, and how Notebooks will be the primary user interface to the backend batch system...

The JupyterLab aspect of the science platform will play a key role in commissioning,
quality assessment, and science validation of the as-built system. It will be the primary
method of performing interactive analysis of acquired data (e.g. adjusting and executing
prepared notebooks driving commissioning tasks), as well as commanding
the batch resources to execute larger processing tasks. Due to this, we expect the
JupyterLab aspect to reach maturity earlier than the others, and certainly in time for
commissioning.

% Data sets acquired during commissioning, as well as precursor and simulated data sets processed for quality assessment and science validation while construction is ongoing, will appear in the commissioning workspace, ready for operator analysis using tools and

\subsection{Web APIs\label{sec:apis}}

\begin{figure}

	\caption{A screen capture of Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables (TOPCAT), that is capable of remotely accessing catalogs using VO protocols. Tools such as these will be able to directly access the data sets served by the LSST DACs (figure credit: Mark Taylor, \url{http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/sun253/sun253.html}).
		\label{fig:toolsTOPCAT}}
\end{figure}

Backend Platform services -- such as access to
databases, images, and other files -- will be exposed through
machine-accessible web APIs. These will serve the data using community-accepted
formats and protocols, making it easy to remotely access the LSST data and DAC	
services. Furthermore, to ensure maximal exposure of the DAC services through
the Web APIs, the other two aspects of the Platform -- Portal and JupyterLab -- will
internally access the LSST datasets using the same Web APIs to the greatest extent possible.

Exposing the LSST data through Virtual Observatory interfaces plays a particularly
important role. It will allow the discoverability of LSST data products from within
the Virtual Observatory, federation of the LSST data set to other
archives, and enable the use of widely utilized tools such as TOPCAT or DS9 by the
end-users. The latter will further lower the barrier to access to LSST data,
shortening the path to science. It will also allow these tools to be used in commissioning.

While this document does not proscribe a full set of protocols and formats
to expose the LSST data, VO Simple Cone Search and TAP (for catalogs) and
SIAP (for images) must be supported.

\subsection{Integrated environment}

All aspects of the LSST Science Platform are intended to be \textit{well integrated}, enabling a seamless workflow so the users to be able to move back and forth between them as needs dictate.  The aim is to enable a user to find or create data in one Platform aspect, and view or analyze that data in another.

As an example of how these connections can aid a user in exploring the LSST data, data queries will be shareable across the Portal and JupyterLab. This will allow a user to build a query using the Portal query builder widget, view the (possibly preliminary) results by browsing it there, and then access the final results from a JupyterLab notebook or a remotely connected client (e.g. TOPCAT) for further analysis. The reverse flow will also be enabled; a user can code and submit a complex SQL query in the Notebook, and then browse and visualize the results in the Portal.

By making the environments integrated, we allow for a shallower learning curve and a gradual transition to more complex environments at the point they are needed. For example, a user may begin interacting with the LSST dataset using the Portal but may ultimately reach the limitations of selection tools exposed through that aspect. The integrated nature of the platform will allow such a user to switch to JupyterLab, and continue working on the data analysis started in the Portal. There, they will be able to import the analysis artifacts (e.g. catalog subsets) as standard Python objects (eg., as astropy.table).

\subsection{Supporting Collaborative Work\label{sec:collab}}

The LSST Science Platform will provide support for collaborative work at two levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Shared workspaces}: Creation and sharing of data sets -- catalogs, images, queries, and other data products -- within either pre-defined or dynamically-created groups (eg., a research group at a university, or a large science collaboration). Such groups would have access to a shared virtual ``workspace'' within the LSST DAC. This workspace will include shared files, shared catalogs (stored in user databases) as well computing cycles allocated to the group as a whole. This shared workspace will be equally ``visible'' from all three aspects of the platform -- e.g., uploads to the workspace will be possible either through a form in the Portal, from JupyterLab, or using a file transfer client.

	\item \textbf{Shared editing}: Although we have no formal requirement to to provide shared editing capabilities,  we envisage supporting a a ``Google Docs''-like collaborative editing, visualization, and data analysis capabilities, via the integration of 3rd-party tools, \emph{if and when these technologies become available in upstream products}. 
	% At present, collaborative editing is on the development roadmap for Jupyter  Notebooks, and will be included into our JupyterLab aspect as it reaches production quality.
\end{itemize}

The levels of support for collaboration described above are responsive to the large majority of user needs identified by end-user focus groups in R\&D. At the same time, they minimize the technical risks by leveraging widely used and well understood technologies (SDSS-like MyDB user databases, backend authentication \& authorization mechanisms, VO protocols, Jupyter).
