\section{Preface\label{sec:preface}}

The purpose of this document is to lay out the high-level vision for the \textbf{LSST Science Platform (LSP)}, a set of web applications and services through which the the scientific community will to access, visualize, interact with, and analyze LSST data holdings. With its companion document -- the Data Products Definition Document (\DPDD) -- it defines the high-level vision for LSST's end-user deliverables.
\\

To a future LSST user, this document should illustrate what will be made available to the science community through the LSST Data Access Centers. To LSST builders, it provides direction on how to flow down the LSST System Requirements Document (\LSR) to Data Management requirements (\DMSR) as they pertain to the end-user services provided at the LSST Data Access Centers.
\\

Though under strict change control, this is a \textbf\emph{living document}. LSST will undergo a period of construction  and commissioning lasting no less than seven years, followed by a decade of survey operations. To ensure their continued scientific adequacy, the high-level vision for LSST Science Platform will be periodically reviewed and updated.
