\setDocAbstract{%
This document defines and describes the ``LSST Science Platform,'' a set of integrated web applications and services deployed at the LSST Data Access Centers (DACs) through which the scientific community will access, visualize, subset, and perform next-to-the-data analysis of the data collected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
\\

These services can be broken down to three different ``Aspects'': a web \textbf{Portal}, designed to provide essential data access and visualization services through a simple-to-use website, a \textbf{Notebook} environment, that will provide a Jupyter Notebook-like interface, based on JupyterLab, enabling next-to-the-data analysis, and an extensive set of \textbf{Web APIs} that the users will be able to use to remotely examine the LSST data set using tools they're already familiar with.
\\

This document lays out the high-level vision for the aforementioned Aspects and some associated backend services.
It is intentionally brief, and meant to generally guide the flow-down of requirements and development of product specifications, prioritization, and plans for the Agile development of the relevant elements of the DM system.
